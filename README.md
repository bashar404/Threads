# Threads in C++11
Every C++ program has at least one thread, which is started by the C++ runtime: *int main()*. 
Bydefault c++ program is a single thread program. If we want to create another thread we need to create inside the main()
**What is concurrency?** concurrency is about two or more separate activities happening at the same time. Ex: 

 1. The browser has multiple tabs & this can be consider as different
 2. threads as   MS word (while typing it format our text and do spell
    checking) 
 3. Auto suggestion #include<..>
